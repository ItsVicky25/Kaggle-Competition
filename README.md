Step 1: Understand the Dataset and Competition Requirements
• Read the documentation carefully to grasp the structure and purpose of each file (basic game results, detailed box scores, geographic data, etc.).
• Familiarize yourself with the submission format and what the competition expects regarding prediction outputs.

Step 2: Data Acquisition and Loading
• Download all the relevant CSV files (e.g., team lists, season details, regular season results, tournament results, detailed box scores, and cities).
• Import the datasets into your analysis environment (Python, R, etc.) and verify that all files are correctly loaded.

Step 3: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
• Check for missing or inconsistent values across datasets (especially in the detailed results files).
• Standardize column names and data types.
• Merge related datasets (e.g., linking team IDs from team files with game results) to create a unified dataset for analysis.

Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• Analyze overall distributions (e.g., points scored, win margins, overtime occurrences).
• Visualize trends over seasons and inspect key statistics that might influence game outcomes.
• Identify potential outliers or anomalies that may require further cleaning.

Step 5: Feature Engineering
• Create new variables that might enhance prediction accuracy. For example:
 - Calculate point differentials, shooting percentages, or rebound margins.
 - Derive indicators for home-court advantage using game location data.
 - Combine detailed box score stats to quantify team efficiency.
• Ensure that features are aligned consistently across different datases.

Step 6: Model Development
• Split your historical data into training and validation sets.
• Select and implement one or more predictive modeling techniques (such as logistic regression, decision trees, ensemble methods, etc.).
• Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and assess model performance.

Step 7: Model Evaluation and Iteration
• Evaluate your models using appropriate metrics (accuracy, AUC, log-loss, etc.).
• Compare different models and refine your feature set based on validation performance.
• Iterate as necessary to improve model robustness.

Step 8: Prediction Generation
• Once satisfied with the model performance, apply your model to generate predicted winning percentages for each possible matchup as defined in the submission format.
• Ensure predictions cover all required pairings and conform to the file structure specified (using the SSSS_XXXX_YYYY ID format).

Step 9: Submission File Preparation and Final Checks
• Format the prediction outputs into the submission file format provided (for example, SampleSubmissionStage1.csv).
• Double-check for any errors or inconsistencies (such as missing matchups or incorrect IDs).
• Validate the file against the competition guidelines.

Step 10: Submit and Monitor
• Submit your final prediction file according to the competition’s instructions.
• Monitor any feedback or performance metrics provided by the competition platform, and be prepared to iterate on your model for future improvements.
